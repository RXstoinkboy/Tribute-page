                        <p>Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie
                        Mercury (lead vocals and piano), Brian May (lead guitar and vocals), Roger Taylor (drums and
                        vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive
                        rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and
                        radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into
                        their music.

                        Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury, then known
                        by his birth name, Farrokh Bulsara, was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with
                        more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined in 1970, suggested the name
                        "Queen", and adopted his familiar stage name. Deacon was recruited before the band recorded
                        their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album,
                        Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at
                        the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian
                        Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and also helped to popularise
                        the music video.

                        The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the
                        Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of
                        the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" (1980) became their
                        best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album
                        in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live
                        Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications.
                        The last concert featuring their classic line up–the final live performance of Mercury–took
                        place at Knebworth, England, in August 1986. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a
                        complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. May and Taylor have performed under the Queen
                        name with Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert as vocalists on tours since.

                        Estimates of their record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one
                        of the world's best-selling music artists. Queen received the Outstanding Contribution to
                        British Music Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990. They were inducted into the
                        Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Each member of Queen has composed multiple hit singles, and
                        all four band members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, the
                        band received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy
                        of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime
                        Achievement Award.
